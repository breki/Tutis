- what's wrong?
    - what's right??

    - the parser code is unreadable
        - local variable names do not mean anything
        - we are using magic strings and numbers (and duplicating them in code, too)
    - the code is pretty brittle - if HTML layout changes, it will be difficult to
        maintain the code

    - we are doing testing on a live service. What happens when the weather changes?

    - a lot of other stuff, but we'll leave it for next steps...
