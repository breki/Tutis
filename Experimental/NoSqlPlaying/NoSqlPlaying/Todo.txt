- easy to insert
- support for spatial indexing (bbox)
- support for querying on tags
- indexing of common tag key-value combinations (highway=residential is 1, for example)
- data structure
    edge:
        edge ID
        mbr
        start node
        end node
        geometry in between (just point coordinates)
        tag? how to store them?
            - separate into common tags and custom tags
            - custom tags are encoded directly into edge blob
            - common tags are stored in a separate table - edge tags (edge ID, tag ID)
            - common tags could also be stored in a blob, to avoid joins
- common tags could be dependent on actual rendering rules and/or some common tag combinations (defined in a file)
