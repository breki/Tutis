- implement optimized filter selection based on heuristics
	- parallelize?
- implement other types of filters

- instead of using in-memory array we should work directly with streams
	- implement filter as a stream?

- experiment with ZLib compression levels

- implement performance tests using actual SRTM tiles
	- experiment with compression level
	- read hgt
	- decide on what the elevation -> grayscale function should be
		- several options that need to be tested regarding the final image size
	- compare the final size of PNG with ZIPs 

- add R# annotations and code contracts to the code
- implement SRTM cell reader from PNG
