- decide on what the elevation -> grayscale function should be
	- several options that need to be tested regarding the final image size

- implement writing of PNG grayscale from an array
	- implement filtering and compressing for each line separately, instead of the whole thing
	- filtering
		- implement filter selection
			- adaptive filtering for each scanline
		- non-raw data source could simply be copied directly into the filtered buffer?

	- break up PngWriter into several classes

- implement performance tests using actual SRTM tiles
	- experiment with compression level
	- read hgt
- compare the final size of PNG with ZIPs 
- add R# annotations and code contracts to the code
