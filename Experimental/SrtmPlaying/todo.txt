- implement writing of PNG grayscale from an array
	- break up PngWriter into several classes
	- PngWriter must be modified to:
		- properly configure IHDR chunk
		- handle grayscale writing (instead of existing RGB)
	- implement performance tests using actual SRTM tiles
		- experiment with compression level
		- read hgt
	- compare the final size of PNG with ZIPs 
- add R# annotations and code contracts to the code
