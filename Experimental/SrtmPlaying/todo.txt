- instead of using in-memory array we should work directly with streams
	- implement filter as a stream?

- implement filtering and compressing for each line separately, instead of the whole thing
- filtering
	- implement filter selection
		- adaptive filtering for each scanline
	- non-raw data source could simply be copied directly into the filtered buffer?

- implement performance tests using actual SRTM tiles
	- experiment with compression level
	- read hgt
	- decide on what the elevation -> grayscale function should be
		- several options that need to be tested regarding the final image size
	- compare the final size of PNG with ZIPs 

- add R# annotations and code contracts to the code
